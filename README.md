# Hey there, I'm Vamsi Munjuluri! 👋

🎓 Graduated from UIC with a Master's in Computer Science, I've developed a strong foundation in data science and recently delved into web development. 🌐

🖥️ My newfound passion for web development is fueled by my love for creativity and a desire to build visually appealing websites. I'm currently exploring UI/UX and front-end development to enhance my skills in creating interactive and aesthetic web experiences.

📸 When I'm not coding, I'm a photographer, capturing the world through my lens and bringing a unique perspective to my projects.

🎨 I'm on a journey to learn creative coding, aiming to merge technical skills with visual artistry. Check out my repositories for a blend of data insights and creative web projects!

🔗 Let's connect! I'm eager to collaborate and innovate with others passionate about tech.

Here's to creating something amazing together!
